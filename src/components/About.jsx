        I am a Python developer with fullstack experience who is actively
        transitioning into AI engineering.
        <br />
        With a background in webdev, data science, and Python, I am currently
        building AI SAAS products of my own. I'm excited by the applications of
        vector embeddings and LLMs for perfect recall (never lose an idea), idea
        networking (proliferate that idea) and digital knowledge twins (a
        digital agent tailored to iterate and execute ideas) based on users'
        online histories, prompts and improved tool use.
        <br />
        I believe we are on the cusp of the greatest digital revolution and I am
        devoted to learning all I can about the coming Intelligence Age, powered
        by neural networks and transformers.
        <br />I combine a keen eye for detail with quick learning ability,
        making me an effective team player who can adapt to emerging
        technologies. I'm passionate about radical innovation and scalable,
        intuitive solutions that address real-world problems. Let's work
        together!
